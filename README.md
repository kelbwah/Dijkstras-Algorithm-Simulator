# Dijkstra's Algorithm Simulator
This is a simulator of Dijkstra's Algorithm using pygame that lets you drag and drop nodes that you create on a screen,
and also set weights to each node from every other node and then see the fastest route between the start and target vertex.

## Download Instructions:

### Windows (.exe file) - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nY_3Ikm5FXxIg6Y2PY6WXC2WTIObVxXC/view?usp=sharing
  After downloading this file, you must find the the titled "Dijkstras_Algorithm_Simulation.exe" and double-click it to run. You can also create it as a shortcut to you desktop and run it from there. (The icon was obtained from https://github.com/Samuele458/visual-dijkstra/tree/main/src)

### Mac/Windows (non-executable method):
  1. If you want to be able to run my program of an IDE of your choosing, you can clone this git repository to your computer or simply press "Code" on the top right of my repository and then download the zip file.
  2. Once you have the zip file or the repo cloned onto your computer, simply open the IDE of your choosing and then locate and add the folder that contains the source code and then run the file titled: "Dijkstras_Algorithm_Simulation.py"

## Steps to start the simulation:
### Step 1 - Add nodes and double-click them to specify the start and target vertexes
### Step 2 - Using your right click, drag your mouse from one vertex to another to set a connection and a weight to both vertexes
### Step 3 - Once you have start and target vertexes and connections between them, you can then press 'start' to see the fastest route between the start and target vertex
